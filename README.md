# Motion-Deblur-by-Learning-Residual-from-Events
This is an official PyTorch implementation of "Motion Deblur by Learning Residual from Events"  (TMM 2024). Authors: Kang Chen and Lei Yu.

In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Residual-based Motion Deblurring (TRMD) framework for an event camera, which converts a blurry image into a sequence of sharp images, leveraging the abundant motion features encoded in events.
